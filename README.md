#### Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by an open-source To-Do List app I found on GitHub:  
[Original Repository](https://github.com/CodeTraversal/JavaScript-Projects)  
I extended and refactored the project by adding new features such as task priorities, due dates, real-time search, filters, localStorage persistence, responsive design, and improved UI/UX.
